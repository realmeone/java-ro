## Why not all in Kotlin?
Because some heavy compute in Java are faster than Kotlin, like Hashing, Signature.
so if there is a jar lib had such methods, we can do these in kotlin, else we use Java to implements.

I am very expect on native kotlin release, at that time, we can use Kotlin to implements.
